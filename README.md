# The Happiness Primer (aka Happy Primer) (Work in Progress)

Positive emotion, or "happiness", has been proven to fuel performance. The Happiness Primer is intended to provide a quick
dose of positive emotion whenever you need it. This idea is based on the principles of Positive Psychology as described
in [Sean Achor's](http://www.shawnachor.com/) book, ["The Happiness Advantage"](http://www.shawnachor.com/the-books/the-happiness-advantage/).
